        Dear Chloe, Happy 2nd Anniversary! You may be bored with letters at this point but this time I won't write a super long one like my previous 700 word one. I just want to tell you that ever since 
        we start dating exactly two year ago, my love for you has only grown immensely every single day. You are my soulmate and I only want you for the rest of my life. I want many many more anniversaries
        in the future, each of them with new surprises and commitments. I want to have a life with you, have a future with you, and spend the rest of my life with you by my side. Today, our relationship turns
        2 years old, and I sincerely hope that our love for each other will only grow as the years go by.
        <br />
        Once again, Happy 2nd Anniversary to my beautiful girlfriend. I love you. More than you will ever know.
